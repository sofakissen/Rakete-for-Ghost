# Rakete

An edit of the default theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/) by [Sofakissen](http://raummaschine.de]). That's me. I made it for my blog [Die Raummaschine](http://blog.raummaschine.de). I guess you call this kind of behaviour "fork", right? I'm not sure, I know almost nothing about such things. I like ice cream. Do you like ice cream? Ice cream is awesome, even in winter.

I added the default header image to post pages, a comment section via Disqus and microdonations with Flattr. Remember that you need to change the Disqus shortname in the post.hbs and default.hbs - you also need to paste your own Flattr button into the post.hbs.
